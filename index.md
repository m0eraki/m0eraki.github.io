# 곽경주 (郭炅周, Kyoung-ju Kwak)

I am Kyoung-ju Kwak and **Moeraki** is one of my favourite place in New Zealand. Frankly Wanaka and Tekapo are the most but somebody already took those names in Github. For that reason, I altenatively chose Moeraki as my handle in Github.  
I am mainly interested in Threat Intelligence and tracing threat actors.
